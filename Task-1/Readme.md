## üéØ Objective

To develop a strong conceptual foundation in **System-on-Chip (SoC)** design  
and understand how **functional modelling** plays a key role in validating SoC behavior  
before moving to RTL and physical design stages.

## üß© 1. Understanding System-on-Chip (SoC)

A **System-on-Chip (SoC)** is a microchip that combines multiple essential components  
of a computer or electronic system‚Äîsuch as **processor, memory, interconnect, and peripherals‚Äîon a single silicon die**.

SoCs are designed for high efficiency, reduced power consumption, and compactness.  
They serve as the backbone of modern embedded systems, enabling advanced processing within minimal space.

### üî∏ Key Features
- Integration of multiple subsystems on one chip.  
- Reduced power consumption and latency.  
- Faster communication through on-chip interconnects.  
- Optimized cost and improved performance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Components of an SoC

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **CPU (Processor Core)** | Executes instructions and controls overall operations. |
| **Memory (ROM/RAM)** | Stores program data and instructions. |
| **Interconnect/Bus** | Connects CPU, memory, and peripherals for data exchange. |
| **Peripherals** | Interfaces such as UART, SPI, GPIO, DAC, etc., that communicate with external devices. |
| **PLL (Phase-Locked Loop)** | Provides clock synchronization and timing accuracy. |
| **Power Management** | Ensures stable operation through regulated voltage and power distribution. |

## üß† 3. Types of SoCs

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Application-Specific SoC (ASIC)** | Designed for a dedicated function or product. | MediaTek or Qualcomm chips |
| **General-Purpose SoC** | Configurable for multiple applications. | Raspberry Pi SoC |
| **FPGA-Based SoC** | Combines CPU with programmable logic for flexible design. | Xilinx Zynq |
| **Educational/Research SoC** | Simplified architecture for training and experimentation. | **VSDBabySoC** |

## üß© 4. Introduction to VSDBabySoC

The **VSDBabySoC** is an **open-source educational SoC** created to help learners  
understand SoC structure, functional behaviour, and integration of digital and analog systems.  
It is based on the **RVMYTH RISC-V core**, developed under the **SkyWater Sky130 open-source technology**.

### üèóÔ∏è Key Components
- **RVMYTH Core (RISC-V):** 32-bit processor that executes program logic.  
- **PLL (Phase-Locked Loop):** Maintains clock precision and timing control.  
- **10-bit DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter):** Converts digital outputs to analog signals.  
- **Bus Interconnect:** Facilitates communication between core, DAC, and memory.  
- **Memory Module:** Stores instructions and operational data.  

### üßæ Design Purpose
The BabySoC model serves as a **learning platform** that bridges theoretical SoC principles  
with practical hardware design, simulation, and system verification.  

It emphasizes:
- Understanding **processor-peripheral interaction**.  
- Visualizing **clock synchronization** via PLLs.  
- Exploring **digital-to-analog conversion** mechanisms.

## üî¨ 5. Role of Functional Modelling

**Functional Modelling** is the first stage in SoC design ‚Äî  
it focuses on describing the logical behaviour of each module **without implementation details**.

### üîπ Purpose
- To verify the **functionality** of system components before RTL coding.  
- To ensure **data flow and control signals** work as expected.  
- To detect logical errors early in the design process.  
- To define module interactions and timing dependencies.

### üîπ Importance
Functional models act as the **conceptual blueprint** of an SoC.  
They simplify complex designs, help simulate system responses, and ensure  
that when RTL design begins, every module behaves correctly at the system level.

## üí° 6. Applications of SoC Design

| Domain | Application |
|--------|--------------|
| **Consumer Electronics** | Smartphones, Smart TVs, Cameras |
| **Automotive Systems** | Engine controllers, Infotainment processors |
| **IoT Devices** | Smart sensors, Edge computing modules |
| **Healthcare Systems** | Portable medical devices and monitors |
| **Industrial Automation** | Motor controllers, PLCs |
| **Educational Tools** | Open-source learning platforms like VSDBabySoC |

### üî∏ BabySoC Applications
- Demonstrating RISC-V processor-based system behavior.  
- Studying DAC-based analog output generation.  
- Exploring open-source chip design using Sky130.  
- Building foundation for custom SoC design and verification.
