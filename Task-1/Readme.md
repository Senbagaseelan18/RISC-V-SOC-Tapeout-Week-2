## 🎯 Objective

To develop a strong conceptual foundation in **System-on-Chip (SoC)** design  
and understand how **functional modelling** plays a key role in validating SoC behavior  
before moving to RTL and physical design stages.

## 🧩 1. Understanding System-on-Chip (SoC)

A **System-on-Chip (SoC)** is a microchip that combines multiple essential components  
of a computer or electronic system—such as **processor, memory, interconnect, and peripherals—on a single silicon die**.

SoCs are designed for high efficiency, reduced power consumption, and compactness.  
They serve as the backbone of modern embedded systems, enabling advanced processing within minimal space.

### 🔸 Key Features
- Integration of multiple subsystems on one chip.  
- Reduced power consumption and latency.  
- Faster communication through on-chip interconnects.  
- Optimized cost and improved performance.

## ⚙️ 2. Components of an SoC

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **CPU (Processor Core)** | Executes instructions and controls overall operations. |
| **Memory (ROM/RAM)** | Stores program data and instructions. |
| **Interconnect/Bus** | Connects CPU, memory, and peripherals for data exchange. |
| **Peripherals** | Interfaces such as UART, SPI, GPIO, DAC, etc., that communicate with external devices. |
| **PLL (Phase-Locked Loop)** | Provides clock synchronization and timing accuracy. |
| **Power Management** | Ensures stable operation through regulated voltage and power distribution. |

## 🧩 4. Introduction to VSDBabySoC

The **VSDBabySoC** is an **open-source educational SoC** created to help learners  
understand SoC structure, functional behaviour, and integration of digital and analog systems.  
It is based on the **RVMYTH RISC-V core**, developed under the **SkyWater Sky130 open-source technology**.

### 🏗️ Key Components
- **RVMYTH Core (RISC-V):** 32-bit processor that executes program logic.  
- **PLL (Phase-Locked Loop):** Maintains clock precision and timing control.  
- **10-bit DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter):** Converts digital outputs to analog signals.  
- **Bus Interconnect:** Facilitates communication between core, DAC, and memory.  
- **Memory Module:** Stores instructions and operational data.  

### 🧾 Design Purpose
The BabySoC model serves as a **learning platform** that bridges theoretical SoC principles  
with practical hardware design, simulation, and system verification.  

It emphasizes:
- Understanding **processor-peripheral interaction**.  
- Visualizing **clock synchronization** via PLLs.  
- Exploring **digital-to-analog conversion** mechanisms.

## 🔬 5. Role of Functional Modelling

**Functional Modelling** is the first stage in SoC design —  
it focuses on describing the logical behaviour of each module **without implementation details**.

### 🔹 Purpose
- To verify the **functionality** of system components before RTL coding.  
- To ensure **data flow and control signals** work as expected.  
- To detect logical errors early in the design process.  
- To define module interactions and timing dependencies.

### 🔹 Importance
Functional models act as the **conceptual blueprint** of an SoC.  
They simplify complex designs, help simulate system responses, and ensure  
that when RTL design begins, every module behaves correctly at the system level.
